The project focuses on:

Data Preprocessing:
Tokenization
Lemmatization
Removal of stop words and symbols
Feature Extraction:
Using CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer for text representation.
Classification Models:
Training and evaluating Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVC), and Random Forest classifiers.
Model Evaluation:
Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and cross-validation.
Visualizing results with confusion matrices.

Key Insights:

Model Comparison: Compares the performance of different machine learning models and feature extraction techniques.
Preprocessing Impact: Analyzes the impact of text preprocessing steps on model performance.
Model Selection: Identifies the best-performing model for the given dataset.
